# Muscles

## Composition
A muscle is a bundle of fascicles, which is a bundle of myocytes, or muscle cells.
Muscles are activated at the fascicle level.

There are 3 types of muscle tissue:
* Type 1
 * Slow twitch
 * Best at aerobic-based activities
* Type IIA
 * Fast twitch
 * Best at very short anaerobic-based activities
* Type IIX
 * Faster twitch
 * Best at longer anaerobic-based activities

Each individual muscle is made up of an assortment of these three types.

## Recruitment
Fascicles are recruited in order of strength. Weaker fascicles are recruited first followed by stronger and stronger fascicles. Because of this recruitment strategy, smaller muscles get used more often and are relatively higher proportionally in Type I muscle.
The total strength produced by the muscle depends on the strength of the total neural message from the motor cortex to the muscle as a whole.

## Force-Length Properties
A muscle has a differing maximum forces depending on the deviation from its [resting length](muscle resting length)\.

The active curve is the force created by [contracting the muscle](muscle contraction)\. 
The passive curve is the force of stretching a muscle.
The optimal range is determined by the peak of the total curve (active + passive).


## Force-velocity Properties
A muscle has a differing maximum force depending on the contraction speed, for both [eccentric muscle contractions](eccentric muscle contraction) and [concentric muscle contractions](concentric muscle contraction)\.
