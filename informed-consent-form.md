There are a few things you should do to prepare to run a participant through informed consent:
* You should read over the most recent [consent form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q0zi6EQFc2kpgSVBA9yvGSoDjFq9jkBf6wrOOSm63rs/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs)
* You will want to get practice running through the informed process.  Generally you do a quick run through of the sections with a sentence or 2 about what is in each section.
