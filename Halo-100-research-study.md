# Halo 100 series:  

## Halo 100: (pilot study)
* Task: finger sequence test (FST), box and block task, pegboard task
* Stimulation: sham 0.4 mA or 1.6 mA over M1 for 15 minutes 
* Type of Stimulation: tDCS 
* 21 subjects analyzed 
* Results: Small improvement in all groups from pre to post
 * 2.7 points (95% CI: -0.67 to 6.2, p = 0.11)
 * No additional improvement in either stimulation group
 * High-amplitude stim: -0.24 points (p = 0.84)
 * Low-amplitude stim: -0.35 points (p = 0.79)
* Implications: No effectiveness of stimulation for improvement in FST, inconclusive results 
  
## Halo 101: 
* Task: Motor synergy task (“chord configuration”) i.e. CCT
* Stimulation: 1.8 mA to M1 for 25 minutes
* Type of Stimulation: tDCS
* 43 subjects analyzed
* Results: Dexterity improvement with respect to baseline was significantly different (p=0.07) for sham (n=14) vs. treatment (n=14)-i.e. both groups took less time to complete task as they practiced, but improvement was significantly greater in stim group 
* Implications: Stimulation shows promise at reducing performance time, but p values were still rather large

## Halo 102: 
* Task: CCT
* Stim: 1.8 mA or sham over M1 for 25 mins (2 days) 
* Type of stimulation: tDCS
* 56 subjects analyzed
* Results: messy data / Inconclusive results 
* Implications: 

## Halo 103:
* Task: CCT 
* Stimulation: Sham, 1.4 or 1.8 m to M1 for 25 mins
* Type of stimulation: tDCS 
* Sham: n = 13, 1.4 mA: n = 12, 1.8 mA: n = 12 
* Better calibration reduced noise enormously
* Results: 
 * 1.4 mA significantly improves motor learning
 * 1.8 mA is indistinguishable from sham because it interferes with learning in a few people
* Slope with time in 1.4 mA significantly different from sham (p = 0.0099)
* Improvement of 1.4 mA in post-test also sig dif from sham (p = 0.0032)
* Implications: First study that showed really great results… confirmation that this product works 

## Halo 104: 
* Task: CCT
* Stimulation: 1.1 or 1.4 mA or sham to M1 for 15 min
* Type of stimulation: tDCS
* Stim: n=29, Sham: n=11 
* Results: No significant result in the difference in percent improvement between groups was found. 
* Implications: We hypothesize that 1.1 mA or 1.4 mA for 15 minutes is not a sufficient amount of stimulation to significantly enhance motor performance. Future studies may benefit from increasing the amount or duration of stimulation, or the number of sessions.
