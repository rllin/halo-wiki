Controller phone showing low battery, plugged in for a few minutes and it started up with 100% battery, not sure why. AC
Still have to walk around participant in new room configuration for room 1, but still better than before.maybe there is still a better organization. AC
People should all download the excel version of the MVC-04 form and insert answers manually in case the internet goes out!! Or else you’ll be in quite a pickle... DW 
The tape did not stay on his arm well (he had very hairy arms). Had to use new tape a couple times. Maybe worth getting better tape
Wifi in Room 2 has not been working, so have not been able to get IDs from the script

There is a window of time that noise is being recorded while we’re zooming in. Is there a way to eliminate this noise? Maybe get subject in the ready position and instruct them not to move after we press start? AS SOLUTION: leave pinch gauge on the table until zoomed and then hand to them
Let’s add hooks to the side of the table to hang the EMG wires so they don’t get so tangled and look more pro. AS SOLUTION: Aaron is taking care of

If high BP and/or HR, try 6 breaths. 3 seconds in, hold for 3 seconds, 3 seconds out

People get really sleepy/bored during video→ during the 2nd round of testing (online), the guy fell asleep→ maybe change video to something a little more stimulating? DW SOLUTION: Can’t change during this trial. Next trial, shorter videos? More interesting videos? Or games?
To reiterate something Alise said, how hard people push is really a function of how loudly/passionately you say “Go!” → my guy did his best on the last round because he I said “Go!” louder (since he was falling asleep earlier) and then he really tried (also was anticipating the extra ten dollars so perhaps people try harder on the last round?) DW
I see this too.  let’s consider maybe an automated voice or make sure we’re always saying it monotone.  Although I am biased because I unreasonably believe that anything that can imaginably be a paper should be controlled for, I want to look at male subject performance in a strength based study with a female investigator (now that we have two) versus the other combinations. -RL
Issue with stimulator not displaying low battery in the beginning of stim, but dying after 15 mins → need to replace? DW SOLUTION/TEMPORARY FIX: Always check at end of trial and change if low

Computer needs to be plugged in during videos or it will die after a few sessions - BC
Should standardize where we unplug—unplugging from wall removes more noise? Not sure why this would be but possible that some interference transmitted through table from socket? SOLUTION: reverse table in room 1
I thought through it.  I bet there’re transformers in the box for the power cable.  transformers just oscillate magnetic fields so anything even remotely transformer shaped in the laptop-emg circuit will pick up some of it.
I think we should also connect the dongle directly to the laptop instead of through the usb cord.  that decreases the amount of time for random em fields to screw with our data. SOLUTION: move dongle directly to laptop
lets get an extension for room one then if that’s the case, it makes no sense reaching around the subject’s chair
Signed informed consent signature pages go face down in the basket on Alise’s desk. Needs to be replaced with a new one before next subject shows up (mostly commonly forgotten “cleaning” item) \
