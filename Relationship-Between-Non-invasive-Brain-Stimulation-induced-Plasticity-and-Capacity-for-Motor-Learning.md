56 people who have had [[NIBS]] [non-invasive brain stimulation](NIBS) in a previous study

Stim Protocols: (details in paper)
* A [[tDCS]] (anodal transcranial direct current stimulation)
* [[iTBS]] (intermittent theta-burst stimulation))
* [[PAS]] (paired associative stimulation)

3 Tasks: 
* SRTT: Serial reaction time task
 * 4 buttons under fingers. when one was marked on the computer screen, subject pushed the corresponding button. 
 * 8 test blocks of 120 buttons. Blocks 1 & 6 pseudorandom, other blocks repeats of a 12 button sequence.
 * Retention measured 45 mins and 24 hours after end of session
* VAT: Visuomotor adaptation task with a joystick
 * Joystick that was covered so the subject couldn't see his/her hand controlled cursor
 * Circle on screen. Target appeared in one of 8 equidistant points on the circle. 
 * Subject was to the cursor towards the target as quickly and accurately as possible
 * 5 sessions of 152 trials:
 * * Baseline - normal
 * * Adaption - +60degree angle displacement between joystick and cursor
 * * 2 Consolidation sessions 45 min and 24 hours after adaption session
 * * De-adaption - cursor and joystick angle restored
* SVIPT: Sequential visual isometric pinch task
 * Similar to our tracking task but meant to be in one swift push
 * 35-45% max
 * 6 blocks of 30
 * Measured 24 hours after

Categorizing Subjects: (responder and non-responder)
* Baseline measures:
 * [[Resting Motor Threshold]] (RMT)
 * [[Active Motor Threshold]] (AMT)
 * 20 Baseline [[Motor Evoked Potential]] (MEPs) (Stimulus intensity to elicit a 1 mV (SI1mV) peak-to-peak amplitude
* NIBS session (each subject did all three stim protocols in random order at least a week apart)
* After each protocol was delivered, MEP amplitude was measured at 5-min intervals for 60 min
* TwoStep cluster analysis into responders and non-responders for each stim protocol (people could be R in one protocol and NR in another)

Results:
* No significant differences were observed between clusters in any NIBS protocol and any learning or renention variable tested for the three tasks
* Individual MEP data from AtDCS significantly predicted angle error in the consolidation 1 and de-adaptation blocks of the VAT
* Subjects with higher increases in cortical excitability after AtDCS show less adaptation than those subjects where AtDCS is ineffective at producing changes in cortical excitability.
* Subjects with higher increases in cortical excitability after AtDCS show less adaptation than those subjects where AtDCS is ineffective at producing changes in cortical excitability in VAT test.
* Responses to AtDCS and iTBS are more closely linked to retention of new skills than PAS
* MEP changes during the first half-hour post-iTBS could predict retention on the SRTT, while max MEP changes after AtDCS could predict retention on the VAT
* Both AtDCS- and iTBS-induced plasticity correlates with the reaction time during the randomized block of the SRTT. AtDCS shortened RT compared to sham constantly in each block.

Discussion:
* Excitatory conditioning of the primary motor cortex is probably not sufficient to influence or predict the behavioral output, therefore learning tasks used in our study involved a far more complex neural network and thus, may dilute any possible relationship between motor learning and the modulation induced by NIBS on M1. 
* Basically, the potentially small neural change in the motor cortex from a single session may not be large enough to manifest a behavioral change.
* NIBS-induced MEP changes and motor learning performances were recorded on different days.

Halo Thoughts:
* Unclear whether the subjects received stimulation before/during the tasks or only for the initial responder classification.
* Everything they looked at was fine motor movements. It would be very difficult to see changes with only 1 training session (some tasks were split into multiple blocks, but there was only one "stimulation session").
