You can sign up for a SoCRA account [here](https://www.socra.org/membership/applications-and-renewals/apply-for-new-membership/). There is a $75 fee to register, so please use your own card we will reimburse you.

The certification will be done through the [CITI website](https://www.citiprogram.org). Click "Register" under create account, search for SoCRA as the organization, and fill out your information. You can enter in "1" as your SoCRA ID for now. You'll want to sign up for two training modules - Good Clinical Practice and Human Subjects Research (Biomedical). You can select "no" for the parts that ask you about receiving credit. If it asks you for a department, just write "Research."

It is a bit tedious, so we recommend breaking it up over a week or two. When you're done, please save the PDFs of your completion reports.
