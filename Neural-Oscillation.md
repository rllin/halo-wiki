[Neural oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_oscillation)

"Oscillatory activity in groups of neurons generally arises from feedback connections between the neurons that result in the synchronization of their firing patterns." (Wikipedia)

"The interaction between neurons can give rise to oscillations at a different frequency than the firing frequency of individual neurons." (Wikipedia)

"...neural oscillations have been linked to cognitive states, such as awareness and consciousness." (Wikipedia)

"oscillatory activity of distant neural structures (single neurons or neural ensembles) can synchronize" (Wikipedia) 

"Neurons in a neural ensemble rarely all fire at exactly the same moment, i.e. fully synchronized. Instead, the probability of firing is rhythmically modulated such that neurons are more likely to fire at the same time, which gives rise to oscillations in their mean activity" (Wikipedia)
