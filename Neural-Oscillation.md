[Neural oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_oscillation)

"Oscillatory activity in groups of neurons generally arises from feedback connections between the neurons that result in the synchronization of their firing patterns." (Wikipedia)

"The interaction between neurons can give rise to oscillations at a different frequency than the firing frequency of individual neurons." (Wikipedia)
