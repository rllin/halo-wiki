SUMMARY: Mehta (2014) Montage Matters: The Influence of Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation on Human Physiological Tremor

Subjects: 12 (M: 9, F: 3)
Age: Mean: 26, Range: 19-36
Handed: All Right Handed
No Caffeine ingestion an hour prior or during
Comfortable Chair
Well lit room
Earplugs to abate auditory clicks with photic stimulation (would this abate clicks?)
Extend wrist with fingers splayed until comfortable
Copper loops around fingers
Subject asked to check that they could remove their hand then resume the position
Subject asked to remain vigilant: eyes open, directed at splayed fingers
Accelerometer (Twente Medical Systems International B.V.)
Affixed to dorsum of middle finger
Tri-axial
Sampled at 2048 Hz
Recorded with 32-channel Porti7 amplifier (Twente Medical Systems International B.V.)
Two cycles of six blocks
Blocks are randomly organized
FO
cM1
rSh
lSh
Sham
Photic
180s
30s rest or more if fatigued
Found M1 to locate the motor hotspot to evoke right finger movement, corresponds with C3
Stim with 5x7 cm rubber electrodes through saline soaked sponges
Impedance as measured was monitored to remain below 10kohm
Stim
Sinusoidal
DC offset = 0
Current p-p = 2mA
Frequency = matched to nearest 0.1Hz 
10s ramp up, 10s ramp down during sham with random return electrode
