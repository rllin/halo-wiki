# Welcome to the Halo wiki!

This is an attempt to decrease the [tribal nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_knowledge) of our knowledge and increase our [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor).  Inspired by [this blog post](https://blog.pusher.com/learnt-making-company-wiki/) and made possible by [jingo](https://github.com/claudioc/jingo) based on [gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum)

## Quickstart
 - Log in with your Halo account
 - Create a page!  Is there something only you know the details of?  Is there something you wish you had known when you first joined?  Is there something you want in a permanent place rather than in random learning documents strewn all over Google Drive?
