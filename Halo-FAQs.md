# Halo FAQs
These are questions that you may be presented with when talking about Halo formally with potential partners or informally with friends and family. It is important that as a company we address these questions in a consistent way!

## How does it work?
Different people ask for different levels of detail here.
* Simple- Neuropriming technology improves the brain’s response to training, and enable the motor cortex to send stronger and more synchronous signals to muscle groups. Halo Sport helps athletes get more out of their workout, leading to accelerated improvements in strength, explosiveness, and skills.
* Moderate- induces a state of “hyperplasticity” or “hyperlearning” that lasts for about an hour.
In our sports product, we’re focusing the waveform on the motor cortex so that athletes learn at an accelerated rate. Learning for an athlete is not just about skills. One can also learn to be stronger. This is no news to athletic trainers and coaches. Studies show that the strength is limited neurologically.
* Complicated - the electric field changes the resting membrane potential of the underlying neurons, making it slightly easier for the neuron to fire. this can be shown fairly conclusively with [MEPs](motor evoked potential). as we know, [neurons](neuron) that fire together, wire together - this is how [[neuroplasticity]] works and the cellular basis for learning and memory. if we can get neurons to fire more easily, they will wire more easily and for our athletes, that means their motor system learns at an accelerated rate. we have demonstrated this effect in both motor coordination and [motor strength/explosiveness](muscle contraction).

Basically, there are two reasons why it works:
1. You perform better during practice (if you lift more during training, you will get to activate more motor units) or (inclusive) 
2. You have a more “effective / primed” practice (if your cortical circuits responsible for coordinating the correct muscles at the correct time are more tunable, they will tune faster).

## Is it safe?
We engineer everything to medical grade - design controls, risk analysis, quality procedures, electronics testing, mechanical testing.
We've tested about 1000 subjects at our test facility and haven't observed any adverse effects. We query subject before and after testing with us for safety and also give them our phone number and ask them to call us in the hours, days, weeks after if there are any problems.
There are also ~2000 articles of 3rd party research.
Both 3rd party research and ours have excellent safety profiles.

## How long/often do I have to wear it?
Halo Sport works best when used at the start of any workout. We've seen the best results when used about 20 minutes per day, 3-5 days per week.

## How long will the gains last?
What you’re asking about is what scientists call “durability of response.” Your concern is that you might lose any of the gains that you make. This has been studied and is not the case.
Halo piggy-backs on how your brain already learns, it just accelerates the learning process, so any skill or strength gains won't be lost when or if you stop using it.

## How much will I improve? How long will it take?
It depends on your starting point, but we’ve seen ~15% gains in leg power and jump height in two weeks with highly trained athletes (~15%). If you’re a beginner, you can experience gains in a single session. If you’re an expert, it can take a couple of weeks.

## Does everyone get better with this?
Overall, athletes using Halo get better. This is also a training supplement similar many others. You can't just put this on, sit on the couch, and get better. Your training staff knows how to improve your performance, we're just using neuroscience to help accelerate that improvement.

## Is there a possibility that I’ll get worse?
In almost 1000 subjects tested, we never seen people get worse. This is also a training supplement similar many others. You can't just put this on, sit on the couch, and get better. Your training staff knows how to improve your performance, we're just using neuroscience to help accelerate that improvement.

## How do I make sure that the electrodes are in the right place?
We took care of that for you. Just put on the headphones like any pair of headphones and you’re good to go.

## Is it possible that I use it incorrectly? or unsafely?
The device checks for stim that’s out of spec 10 times per second.
Your login will also lock out so you can’t overuse it.
The highest amplitude the device can produce is well within safe limits.
The device also checks that the electrodes are placed correctly in the headband and makes good contact with the scalp.

## What does it feel like?
Most people call it a mild tingling/itching sensation, maybe some heat. Some people have a hard time knowing that the stimulator is even on.
