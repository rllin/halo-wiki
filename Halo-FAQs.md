# Halo FAQs
These are questions that you may be presented with when talking about Halo formally with potential partners or informally with friends and family. It is important that as a company we address these questions in a consistent way!

### How does it work? (note: different people ask for different levels of detail here) 
Neuropriming technology improves the brain’s response to training, and enable the motor cortex to send stronger and more synchronous signals to muscle groups.
Halo Sport helps athletes get more out of your workout, leading to accelerated improvements in strength, explosiveness, and skills.
Next level
induces a state of “hyperplasticity” or “hyperlearning” that lasts for about an hour.
In our sports product, we’re focusing the waveform on the motor cortex so that athletes learn at an accelerated rate
Learning for an athlete is not just about skills. One can also learn to be stronger. This is no news to athletic trainers and coaches. Studies show that the strength is limited neurologically.


### How long/often do I have to wear it?
Halo Sport works best when used at the start of any workout. We've seen the best results when used about 20 minutes per day, 3-5 days per week

### How long will the gains last?
Oh, what you’re asking about is what scientists call “durability of response.” I guess the concern is that you would lose your gains at an accelerated rate. Turns out this has been studied and not the case
Halo piggy-backs on how your brain already learns, it just makes it more efficient
You learn it, you keep it. Effects last as long as any other skill you learn
Skiing example

### How much will I improve? How long will it take?
depends on your starting point, but we’ve seen (MJP) ~15% gains in leg power and jump height in two weeks with highly trained athletes. if you’re a relative beginner, you will experience gains in a single session. if you’re an expert, it’ll take about two weeks.

### Does everyone get better with this?
Hmmmmm

### Is it safe?
medical grade - engineering, design controls, risk analysis, quality procedures, electronics testing, mechanical testing
our data - almost 1000 subjects tested. not only query each subject before and after their work with us, give them our phone number and ask them to call us in the hours, days, weeks after if there are any problems
third party data - ~2000 articles - excellent safety profile

### Is there a possibility that I’ll get worse?
In almost 1000 subjects tested, we never seen people get worse

### How do I make sure that the electrodes are in the right place?
we took care of that for you. just put on the headphones like any pair of headphones and you’re good to go

### Is it possible that I use it incorrectly? or unsafely?
10 per second - device checks for stim that’s out of spec
stim lock out so you can’t overuse
highest amplitude the device can produce is well within safe limits
checks that the electrodes are placed correctly in the headband and makes good contact

### What does it feel like?
most people call it a mild tingling sensation. some people have a hard time knowing that the stimulator is even on.


Words to use:
Neuropriming








-- love this question. the prevailing theory on how this works is as follows: the electric field changes the resting membrane potential of the underlying neurons, making it slightly easier for the neuron to fire. this can be shown fairly conclusively with MEPs. as we know, neurons that fire together, wire together - this is how neuroplasticity works and the cellular basis for learning and memory. if we can get neurons to fire more easily, they will wire more easily and for our athletes, that means their motor system learns at an accelerated rate. we have demonstrated this effect in both motor coordination and motor strength/explosiveness. this might be better done over the phone. let's get a quick call scheduled if you'd like to discuss

^In general, you learn faster because you either:
 perform better during practice (if you lift more during training, you will get to activate more motor units) 
or (inclusive) 
have more “effective / primed” practice (if your cortical circuits responsible for coordinating the correct muscles at the correct time are more tunable, they will tune faster).
We should also focus on the prior since we mostly talk about the latter when talking about “learning”.  In fact, most of the papers that show effects for motor coordination and strength happen within one session, and nothing can be said about afterwards.
For strength increases, neural drive during activity which be achieved by an external electric field is sufficient.  Contrast this with fine motor learning where practice is a bit more necessary.  For the components of practice performance quality and practice effectiveness, strength and fine motor are made up of different amounts of each.
For those more machine learning inclined, the analogy is as follows.  For human practice, since execution is imperfect (especially during exploratory practice), your neural net gets fed training sets that are not 100% correctly characterized.  By ensuring your training set is more correctly characterized means your training period will be shorter.  For any learning protocol, you can have a learning rate.  By adjusting you learning rate, you can train shorter.  Of course, this analogy is not perfect only since overfitting is a much more apparent issue in machine learning (not that it isn’t an issue in human learning).




"The neuromuscular system – the nervous system and its interface with the muscles – has adapted to training by becoming able to recruit motor units more efficiently, and it is slower to detrain than are the muscles it innervates. It remembers how to lift heavy weights even if the muscles are out of shape. This neuromuscular efficiency is quite useful when you are in shape, but when you are de-trained, it allows you to lift more than you are actually in condition to do without incurring adverse effects."
The flip side of the last sentence betrays how much of your muscular strength is limited by neural drive and recruitment.
