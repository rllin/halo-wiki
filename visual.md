The Visual system is the main way we interpret the world around us and as such is one of the most understood sensory systems.  starting with the eyes, information is processed from rods and cones, and down the optic nerve to V1.  V1 provides initial processing before sending the information downstream where eventually we have a full understanding of what we are looking at, where it is, if it is moving, and a number of other relevant details.

# The Eye and Transmission to the brain

The Eye is the point from which all visual information enters the brain.  Light enters the eye and is focused onto the retina, a mass of light-activated neurons known as rods and cones.  These neurons provide a constant stream of information that is sent along the optic nerve, across the optic chiasm, and to V1.  As the information hits the optic chiasm, the information is split, with all information coming from the right side of our visual field going to the left V1 while the left side of our visual field is sent to the right V1.  Just like [[motor]] and [[somatosensory]], vision has a contralateral (opposite side) processing set up.

# The Primary Visual Area (V1)

# Dorsal and Ventral Streams

Once the basic lines are processed, the information stream is split into the dorsal and ventral streams, also known as the where and what pathways.
