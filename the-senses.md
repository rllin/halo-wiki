The 5 senses inform our brain of the world around us and as such the brain has areas dedicated just to the interpretation of the constant stream of information coming in.

# Visual (Sight)

The [visual cortex](visual) takes up most of the [occipital lobe](The Brain) in the back of the head and has developed a complex hierarchy to interpret the information coming in from the eyes.

# Auditory (Hearing)

The [auditory cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_cortex) is located in the temporal lobe and has a tonotopic map to process the sounds around us.

# Somatosensory (Touch)

The [somatosensory cortex](somatosensory) has a similar design as the [motor cortex](motor) with slightly different amounts of neurons being dedicated to the different areas of the body.

# Olfaction (Smell)

[Olfaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction) is chemically based and, therefore, is organized slightly differently than the other senses.

# Gustatory (Taste)

The [gustatory cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustatory_cortex) is also activated based on the chemical makeup of the food you eat, similar to the [olfaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction) center.
