Batting is one of the most fundamental and important baseball skills; poorly understood and difficult to master

## Goals:
* Improve upon methodology of previous researchers
* Provide full biomechanical description of the baseball swing
* Compare swings against pitches thrown at different locations/speeds

## Setup
* 43 AA minor league players (1300 trials)
* batting practice in indoor laboratory against live pitcher throwing mix of fastballs and change-ups
* Eight camera motion capture with two force plates
* ball completely covered with reflective tape
* reflective markers attached to players/bats at key points

## Swing phases
* stance
* stride
* coiling
* swing initiation
* swing acceleration
* follow-through

## Key swing events divide phases
* lead foot off
* lead foot down
* weight shift commitment
* max front foot vertical ground force
* bat-ball contact

## Pitch categories tested
* fastball
* high in
* high out
* middle
* low in
* low out
* change-up
* same breakout

## Findings:
* More fully rotated positions, particularly of the pelvis and bat, were critical to the batters’ successes on inside pitches
* less rotated positions keyed successes against outside pitches. 
* The trail and lead arms worked together as part of a closed chain to drive the hand path. 
* Successful swings had the trail elbow extended more for HIGH IN and flexed more for LOW OUT, though batters often struggled to execute this movement properly. 
* A distinct pattern among successful swings against fastballs, successful swings against changeups, and unsuccessful swings against changeups was witnessed; namely a progressive delay in which the batter prematurely initiated the events of the kinetic chain, especially when unsuccessful in hitting a changeup. 

## Recommendations for batting coaches
* get batters to take a consistent approach in the early phases of every swing (particularly for the lower body), 
* identify both pitch type and location as early as possible
* use the rotation of the pelvis to propagate the energy transfer of the kinetic chain from the group to the upper body
* use the pelvis, and subsequently, the upper body, to orient the trunk and hands to an optimal position to drive the ball to the desired field

## Kinetic chain
* energy passed along all of the “links” in your body’s chain
* lower limb -> trunk -> upper limb -> bat
* coordination / timing pattern is critically important for maximum energy transfer

## Batting philosophy

### coaches
* Ted Williams - rotational
* Charlie Lau - linear
coaches often have different vocabularies so it’s important to find unifying principles
instruction can be internally (keep your head down) or externally (swing through the ball) focused

### scientific
* rotational and linear both critical
* tons of studies have been done but all are limited in one way or another
* data collected
 * N
 * types/skill of players
 * “real world” setting
 * etc.

### swing adjustment
* speed
* prepare for a fastball and adjust
* helps to identify the pitch as early as possible
* recommended to study pitcher, watch him warm up, etc.
* location
* hit the ball where it is pitched; i.e. outside -> right field, inside -> pull to left (for right handed batter)
* make as few changes as necessary to hit the ball
* must stride directly toward pitcher because this action must be completed before pitch can be identified
* therefore, adjust swing based on bat/elbow/arm position

### vision and cognition
* incredibly important in batting
* skilled players much better at processing the large amount of visual information required for batting
* skilled players also able to provide much more in-depth analyses/comments on pitches based on same information as novice players

### functional strength
* also important
* however, raw strength does not necessarily translate to increases in bat speed
* merger of technique and strength
* main takeaway: train on baseball-specific skills and not just weights, etc.
* training programs include all of the standard elements we are becoming familiar with
 * dynamic warm-ups
 * plyometric work
 * proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation
 * resistance training
 * medicine ball work has also been shown to be helpful by some studies
 * lower body emphasis more productive than working on arms/wrists/etc.
* donuts / weighted bat warm-ups = dubious effect

## Results
* Few relevant/practical statistical differences between lower body and trunk measurements across pitch types/speeds or success scenarios
* Many significant differences in upper body and bat kinematics, however
* Shoulder abduction
* Trailing elbow extension/flexion
* Ball exit velocity most impacted by upper body / pelvis differences
* batters more successful when opening trunk more for inside pitches and keeping more closed for outside pitches
* similarly, more bat rotation for inside and less for outside
* almost all batters start their early swing phases the same but the execution of the swing motion varies more
* Able to identify the “typical” professional baseball swing by averaging the movements/positions during each pitch type

## Key recommendations for coaches teaching players:
1. develop a strong, consistent approach for every swing in the early phases, particularly with the lower body; 
2. anticipate a fastball for every pitch, but be able to recognize an off-speed pitch as early as possible; 
3. use the powerful rotation of the pelvis to transfer the GRF and help direct the body according to the location of the incoming pitch; and 
4. use the upper body to guide the hands along the appropriate path, putting the bat in a strong, properly angled position to direct the ball from its impact location to its desired destination on the field

## Limitations:
* Non-real world hitting conditions
* indoor
* no cleats
* no helmets
* etc.
* players covered with reflective sensors
 * also, sometimes blocked by netting
* 300Hz capture better than prior studies but likely needs to be about 1000 Hz to really capture moment of impact
* pitch categorization was discrete, while pitches really exist on a continuous spectrum
