> GLP testing requires, by Federal regulation, accurate identification of the test and control articles (e.g., a lot number, batch number or sample code) that allows unambiguous traceability of the tested material. GLP testing also requires that the testing laboratory document characterization of the test and control articles for stability, strength, purity, and composition, or other characteristics which will appropriately define the test or control article. This information is typically provided by the Sponsor and is required for each batch of test or control article tested; this documentation is often in the form of a Certificate of Analysis (C of A). For testing of biomedical devices that contain no drugs, Pacific BioLabs requires documentation of the identity, composition, and stability of the material tested. Failure to provide this information will be noted as noncompliance with GLP regulations in the Final Report
