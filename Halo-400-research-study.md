# Halo 400 Series 
This is the [[research review]] for the Halo 400 Series.

## Halo 400.1
* Task: CCT 
* Stimulation: 470 mA RNS +/- 0.75 mA over M1 for 25 minutes 
* Type of Stimulation: VFS
* 28 subjects analyzed
* Stimulation: n= 20, Sham: n=8
Results: There was no significant difference between the stimulation and sham groups in percent improvement from baseline on the CCT. Additional analyzes including sham subjects from HALO-104.1 likewise found no effect.
* Implications: Though no significant result was found, the noise in the data may be reduced by more precisely targeting cortical structures and increasing focality. To this end, a “trident” electrode montage should be used in HALO-400.2, maintaining the CCT timing and VFS parameters used in HALO-400.1.

## Halo 400.2 
* Task: CCT
* Stimulation: 470 mA RNS +/- 0.75 mA over M1 for 25 minutes (tripolar electrode)
* 29 subjects analyzed
* Stimulation: n=19, sham: n=10
* Results: No significant difference in percent improvement from baseline CCT score was found between stimulation and sham groups. While sham subjects from earlier studies could in theory be added to the present analysis, several key factors discourage the inclusion of these data. First, both sham and stimulation subjects in 400.2 exhibited greater improvement over the course of the study than did sham and stimulation subjects from earlier studies, suggesting that the populations are not comparable. Adding in sham subjects from 400.1 might yield a significant result, but it would be unclear if the result was due to the effects of stim, or mixing in a lower-performing population to the sham group only. Second, 400.2 subjects used the new headset, which is more comfortable than the headband used in previous studies. Since it is plausible that subjects experiencing less discomfort might perform better on the CCT, adding in sham subjects from previous studies might lower the sham performance for reasons unrelated to stimulation group. 
* Implications: Several modifications to the protocol may yield a cleaner result. First, a curved trident should be used to improve contact, especially of the outer two prongs. Second, the RMS value should be modulated to increase the amount of electricity delivered to the brain. This approach is especially feasible given that many subjects receiving real stimulation either did not feel any sensation or felt minimal sensation. Third, additional information should be logged to better track variation between subjects, including coarseness and curliness of hair and usage of gel saline to reduce impedance. Lastly, Cz should be measured, marked, and compared with the natural positioning of the headset to determine error and adjust the headset if needed.

## Halo 400.3
* Task: OSU
* Stimulation: 100-600 Hz <1 mA over right posterior parietal cortex (rPPC) for 15 minutes 
* Type of Stimulation: VFS
* 19 subjects analyzed 
* Stimulation: n=10, sham: n=9
* Results: While the steady improvement in both groups across most measures indicates that the task was well-calibrated, it is clear that there was no effect of treatment (at least not one that is robust enough to be of interest). This suggests that future iterations of the experiment should focus on modifying stimulation parameters rather than task parameters. 
* Implications: Because our first product will target M1, it is worthwhile to consider whether motor cortex stimulation can improve Osu task performance. Because subjects will be using their right hands to control the mouse, we will target left M1 with VFS, with the return electrode on the shoulder (either a sticky electrode or an electrode bound by gauze). We will stimulate for 18 minutes, rather than 15 like in 400.3.We will also enforce three-minute rest periods between testing blocks by having subjects watch videos that will be programmed into Osu maps. Subjects will also complete another 1.5 minutes of practice in the beginning to get them further up the learning curve before calibration and baseline. 

## Halo 400.4
* Task: CCT
* Stimulation: 700mA RNS +/- 1mA over M1 for 25 minutes (tripolar electrode)
* Type of Stimulation: VFS
* 25 subjects analyzed
* Stimulation: n=15 Sham: n=10
* Results: No significant difference in percent improvement from baseline CCT score was found between stimulation and sham groups. When the lower half of subjects according to median baseline time-to-completion, subjects in the stimulation group had a trend of improved performance relative to sham, but the effect was not significant. Lastly, when the lower half of subjects according to median baseline time-to-completion in 400.2 and 400.4 were combined, the effect of stimulation vs. sham was significant at T50.
* Implications: Several modifications to the protocol may yield a significant result. First, increasing the value of n may lead to significance, as the data in fig. 2 of HALO-400.4, as well as in HALO-400.2, suggested a trend towards enhanced performance in the stimulation group relative to sham. Second, a future study should more closely follow the original Waters-Metenier paper by extending the stimulation to two or three days, as the best result was seen on later days. 

## OSU Series

### OSU-01
* Task: OSU
* Stimulation: 100-600 Hz, <1 mA maximum amplitude, 0.7 mA RMS amplitude over M1 for 18 minutes (tripolar electrode)
* Type of stimulation: VFS
* 26 subjects analyzed
* Stimulation: n=13, Sham: 13
* Results: Osu’s standard accuracy measure yields a significant difference between the groups (p=0.04 by test, p=0.02 by block) 
* Implications: The next step is to both replicate this finding and to see whether the effect of stimulation continues for longer durations. As such, the next experiment will be exactly the same as this one, except adding another block at the end. 

### OSU-02
* Task: OSU 
* Stimulation: 100-600 Hz, < 1 mA maximum amplitude, 0.7 mA RMS amplitude over M1 for 18 minutes (tripolar electrode)
* Type of stimulation: VFS
* 27 subjects analyzed
* Stimulation: n=13, sham: n=14
* Results: couldn’t replicate findings from OSU-01, even when combined with the results  from OSU-01
* Implications: adding another block (i.e. a post-post test) yielded insignificant results 

## CCT Series

### CCT-01 
* Task: CCT 
* Stimulation: 700 mA RNS +- 1 mA over M1 for 25 minutes (3 days)
* Type of stimulation: VFS
* 26 subjects analyzed
* Stimulation: n=12, Sham: n=13
* Results: No significant difference in percent improvement in baseline score between stimulation and sham groups was found in CCT-01. 
* Implications: One potential avenue for future research would be to use DC instead of VFS. This stimulation protocol would more closely mirror Waters-Metenier et al. (2014), which was recently replicated successfully.
