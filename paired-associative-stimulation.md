# paired associative stimulation
[Paired associative stimulation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16106657) (PAS) refers to a paradigm consisting of slow-rate repetitive low-frequency median nerve stimulation combined with [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) over the contralateral motor cortex. This protocol has been shown to induce [plastic changes](plasticity) of excitability in the human [motor cortex](Motor). Its principles of design were shaped after associative [[long term potentiation]] (LTP) in experimental animals, a cellular mechanism likely to be relevant for learning and memory.
