# Halo 300 Series
## Halo 300:
* Task: various
* Stimulation: <2 mA or sham over M1 for <30 mins (1-3 days in duration)
* 3 subjects analyzed 
* Results: no main “result” because protocol was used for one-off trials. However, very positive early indicators of improvement in putting performance over three days of training + stim + testing
* Implications: First foray into having a broad trial structure encompassing a number of tasks and stim parameters. Foundational for Halo-400. Initial interesting golf results.
