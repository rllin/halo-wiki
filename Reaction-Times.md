Reaction time distributions are best parameterized by an [Exponential-Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentially_modified_Gaussian_distribution), [Exponential-Wald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_Gaussian_distribution), or [Gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution) distribution, as shown in [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3062635/).
