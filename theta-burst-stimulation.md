# theta burst stimulation
[Theta-burst stimulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta-burst_stimulation) (TBS) is a protocol used in [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]]. It was originally described by Huang in 2005 (Huang 2005 Theta Burst Stimulation of the Human Motor Cortex). 
The protocol has been used in Major Depressive Disorder with stimulation of both right and left [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] (DLPFC), where the left is stimulated (TBS) while the right is inhibited (cTBS).

## theta-burst stimulation pattern (TBS)
3 pulses are administered at 50 Hz, every 200 ms. 

## intermittent theta burst stimulation pattern (iTBS)
A 2 second train of TBS is repeated every 10 s for a total of 190 s (600 pulses).

## continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS)
A 40 s train of uninterrupted TBS is given (600 pulses).
