"Dithering involves the deliberate addition of noise to our input signal. It helps by smearing out the little differences in amplitude resolution. The key is to add random noise in a way that makes the signal bounce back and forth between successive levels. Of course, this in itself just makes the signal noisier. But, the signal smoothes out by averaging this noise digitally once the signal is acquired." [National Instruments](http://www.ni.com/white-paper/3016/en/)
