# Halo 400 MVC 04 Internal Protocol

This page contains Halo's internal protocol for [[Halo 400 MVC 04]]

Protocol: MVC-04
Task: Finger Pinch MVCs under fatigue
Num Subjects: 30+
Stimulation: tDCS- 2 mA, 20 minutes
Total Duration: 90 minutes
Sessions: 1

## STUDY RATIONALE

This study will focus on the ability of tES to improve pinch force and increase muscle activity (motor unit recruitment) under fatigued conditions in healthy subjects. The electrode configurations and stimulation parameters will parallel what has been safely and effectively used in prior studies:
* Anode over right motor cortex (C4) and cathode over left motor cortex (C3)
* 20 minutes of direct current stimulation under 2 mA or 0.0 mA stimulation (sham)

Subjects enrolled, while assuming minimal risk, will also stand to improve their pinch force under fatigued conditions. 

## STUDY DESIGN
 
The proposed study is a single center, double-blind, sham controlled clinical trial. The trial will consist of two groups, one treatment group and one sham treatment group. The treatment groups will receive 15 minutes of direct current stimulation presented in a single, contiguous block. The sham treatment group will receive a subtherapeutic amount of tES that still provides the sensation of stimulation. Once the subject arrives, they will read through and be instructed on the informed consent, will go through the exclusion criteria, and will have baseline physiology tests. Before the headset is set up, EMG electrodes will be placed on the subject’s forearm, just below the thumb. The subject will then complete 3 practice finger pinch maximum voluntary contractions (MVCs) with 15% tracking in between each MVC in order to become familiar with the task and assess the subject’s maximum MVC force. The headset will then be set up before any more testing. Once the headset is set up, the subject will complete the baseline, training, and post-test, with 15 minute “rests” in between each, consisting of a 15 minute video.

Blinding will be maintained by the Halo Neurostimulation system. At randomization of each subject (see below), the subject will be linked with a coded number programmed into the Halo Neurostimulation System. Thenceforth, entry of the coded number will result in delivery of the appropriate stimulation. System behavior in both the treatment and sham groups will appear identical to the clinical trial assistant, and the clinical trial assistant will not be aware of the treatment group assignment.

After subjects are screened for the study, appointments will follow a series of distinct steps:

### Enrollment and orientation
Subject will be asked to review the informed consent form. The clinical trial assistant will leave the room to give the subject time to thoroughly read through the form, and will return after ten minutes. The clinical trial assistant will encourage the subject to ask any questions he or she may have and will ask if the subject would like more time to read through the form. Should the subject request additional time, the clinical trial assistant will again leave the room. The clinical trial assistant will return to the room and again encourage the subject to ask any questions he or she may have. Should the subject choose to participate in the trial, he or she will sign and date the informed consent form and receive a copy, in accordance with HIPAA regulations and California Health & Safety Code §24172 and §24173. Subjects will be asked to fill out their contact information and a questionnaire corresponding to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this protocol. If the subject is appropriate for the trial, he or she will proceed to the baseline phase.

Subjects will be instructed that they will receive $40 in compensation for their time. Subjects will have the opportunity to earn an additional $10 bonus for high personal performance across all tasks.


### Baseline physiology
Baseline blood pressure and heart rate will be assessed.

### EMG setup
The EMG electrodes will be put on the skin of the subject’s left forearm, just below the thumb. Gel can be used to help with conductivity. The subject will wear a grounding electrode that is a wristband on their right wrist (make sure the metal is making contact with a bone). The subject will be allowed to watch their force curve at each trial for visual feedback. 

### Practice
The investigator will explain to the subject how to properly hold the pinch gauge and how to do a maximum effort finger pinch with 15% tracking between each. The subject will then practice 3 MVCs with approximately 15% tracking between each. The investigator will record the maximum MVC force for a true 15% tracking during testing.

### tES set-up
Subjects will have tES sponge electrodes assembled on their head - anode over right motor cortex corresponding to the left hand (C4 in the 10-20 system) and cathode over left motor cortex (C3). The scalp may be marked with a small dot of removable, hypoallergenic eyeliner after the skull has been measured but before the headset is assembled to ensure correct placement of the electrodes. After set-up is complete, the subject will receive tDCS for one minute to ensure that the impedance is within an acceptable range.

### Randomization
Subjects will be randomized to sham or tDCS based on their maximum practice MVC and gender in order to balance the strength of the subjects in the two groups.

Randomization of each subject will be performed by drawing a unique coded number from a set of lists prepared by the clinical trial administrator; these coded numbers will be preprogrammed into the Halo Neurostimulation System and represent sham or tDCS. Entry of the coded number will result in delivery of the appropriate stimulation. The meaning of any coded number is not known to the clinical trial assistant, and the behavior of the Halo Neurostimulation System is designed to appear identical to a normal user in both the treatment and sham cases; for instance, the system will detect high impedance identically in both cases, even when sham stimulation is being delivered.

### Baseline period
EMG recording will start before any testing. The investigator will shrink the graph so that the top of the graph is the maximum MVC force observed during practice. A marker will be placed at 15% of the graph height. Once EMG begins recording, subjects will perform 1 finger pinch MVC every 30 seconds for 3 minutes (7 in total) with constant 15% maximum MVC force tracking in between each MVC. The investigator will stop the EMG recording after the tasks are completed.


### Online testing period
Subjects will receive 20 total minutes of sham or real tDCS. During the first 15 minutes of stimulation, the subject will watch a video. During the final 5 minutes of stimulation the subjects will perform the tasks again with the left hand. Before any tasks begin, the investigator will start the EMG recording again. The tasks will be identical to the baseline task. After the tasks are completed, EMG recording will be stopped.

### Post-test
Once stimulation ends, the subjects will have a 15 minute video rest. After the video, EMG recording will be started again, and subjects will complete the same left-handed tasks.


### tES and EMG removal and safety questionnaire
Once testing ends, the EMG, electrodes and tES headset will be carefully removed from the subject’s skin and head. Subjects will be asked about any potential side effects of stimulation and their responses will be documented. In addition, the contact point on the scalp will be examined for any changes and documented.


### Assessment period
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be assessed after tDCS headset removal. Subjects will also be asked to walk in a straight line and stand on one foot for three seconds to assess basic motor function. If subjects are not able to complete the aforementioned motor tasks, they will remain at the study site until they are able to do so.

### Outtake
Subjects will be asked to guess whether they received real or sham stimulation. They will also be asked to assess their level of tiredness. The clinical trial assistant will give subjects a check compensating them with $40 for their time, with an additional $10 for high personal performance at the investigator’s discretion.


Instructions:
MVC: “Pinch with your thumb as hard and fast as you possibly can for 1-3 seconds.”
Force Tracking: “Pinch down until the force line can be seen just above the marker.”

## Primary Safety Endpoint
 
All adverse events (AEs) observed in the clinical study will be identified and classified as serious versus non-serious, and device-related versus not device-related, as described in the adverse events section of this protocol.
 
AE numbers, incidence, and 95% confidence intervals will be presented separately for treatment and sham groups in three categories: all serious adverse events (SAEs); all AEs; and all serious device-related adverse events. Incidence here is defined as the number of adverse events divided by the number of subjects.
 
The primary safety endpoint shall be met if the Poisson 95% confidence intervals around point estimates of incidence of all SAEs are either overlapping, or non-overlapping such that the incidence in the two treatment groups is lower than the incidence in the sham group.
