#Purpose

Mean frequency is a way of gaining insight into the power spectrum of a signal.  In the case of EMG, that signal originates from the muscle and can, therefore, be used to tell us about the muscle.  the power spectrum of the muscular signal is a measure of the power associated with each frequency once a Fourier's Transformation is applied.

As muscles fatigue their power spectrum shifts to the left, demonstrating a greater amount of low frequencies with weaker high frequencies.  This then pulls the mean frequency down as the power spectrum shifts, and it is this decrease in mean frequency that we then associate with muscular fatigue.

#Advantages over Median Frequency

Just like [[Median Frequency]], mean frequency is a measure of muscular fatigue found by looking at the [[power spectrum]]

#Analysis

The analysis of mean frequency is the same as [[Median Frequency]] except that you take the mean frequency of the power spectrum
