In the brain, there are a few different areas that play a role in motor production.  It starts with the Premotor cortex and the Posterior Parietal cortex which both work to movement idea initiation and coordination.  They send their signal to the primary motor cortex and the supplemental motor cortex for movement initiation signals.  Those signals get sent down the spinal column to the muscles which are activated via neuromuscular junctions and the body moves.

# Movement Idea Initiation

The Posterior Parietal cortex takes information from the visual and other sensory systems to create a representation of the world around us in the brain.  The posterior parietal cortex then communicates with the premotor cortex to plan out specific actions.  Some of these actions require conscious thought (such as picking up a glass) some are unconscious (such as keeping your heart beating) while others require initiation thoughts but are then left on their own (such as walking).

# Muscle coordination

Once the idea of what we want to move is accomplished, the signal is sent to the primary motor cortex to activate the correct neuron paths which will activate the right muscles for the movement.

## Primary Motor Cortex (M1)

The primary motor cortex is also known as M1, Brodmann area 4, the precentral gyrus, or the C row of the 10-20 system.  There is a functional mapping onto M1 such that areas that are near each other in the brain control muscles that are near each other in the body.  A general mapping of the Primary Motor Cortex can be seen below.

One important thing to note is that the brain has a contralateral set up for control.  This means that the primary motor cortex in the left hemisphere of the brain controls the muscles on the right side of the body and vice versa.

Additionally the amount of space given to a specific muscle is important, more space means more neurons which means more control over the movements of that area of the body.  From this information, we can create a muscular homunculus as a representation of where there is muscular control.  There is also a [sensory](Touch) Homunculus based on how much space is dedicated the sense of touch in different areas.

# Brain to Muscle Transmission

Once the appropriate muscles are identified and the neurons of those areas are stimulated in M1, the signal must be transmitted down the spinal column to the muscles. 

## Neuromuscular Junction

To translate the neuronal signal to a muscle contraction, the neuron must communicate with the muscle through the [[nueromuscular junction]]
