# General Map and Naming Conventions

The Brain has a functional anatomy meaning that different areas are in charge of discrete functions such as motor, sensory, memory, and attention.  However, because science is messy, there are a few different ways of identifying a region in the brain.

## Location Naming Conventions

The Location naming convention is generally used for areas that reside on the cortex, the outer layer of the brain that gives the brain the famous wrinkly look.  This Convention is based on dividing the brain into 4 lobes and then locating the area by moving along the x, y, and z axis According to certain medical terms explained below.

### The Four Lobes

### Moving along the 3 axis in the brain

The picture below explains most of the terms, the only one not covered is medial vs lateral, Medial means closer to middle of the brain or body while lateral is moving to the sides.

An example of this naming convention would be the Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)

## Function Naming Conventions

A second way to identify a region of the brain is by function.  This is generally reserved for motor and sensory regions.  For instance, M1 is the Primary motor Cortex while V1 is the Primary visual cortex.  Different number signify other regions associated with that function such as M2 or V2.

## Brodmann Areas

The Brodmann areas are named after a German anatomist and are a little antiquated but still used from time to time.  The map below shows the numbers associated with each area of the brain.

## 10-20 system

The 10-20 system is a placement system developed for EEG electrodes, but has been adopted to identify some general regions of the cortex.  In general, the letters signify a lobe of the brain and the numbers represent how medial or lateral an aea is, with larger numbers being more lateral.  Even numbers are on the right, odd numbers are on the left, a "z" in place of a number is down the middle. The image below is a simple version, but it can be expanded to have more numbers or more rows with letters signifying in between (CP means between the C or central row and P or parietal row).

## General Names

Finally some areas simply have names.  These are generally reserved for non-cortex areas such as the Hippocampus or the Amygdala.

# Brain Functions

The Following are deeper dives into the different functions that the brain accomplishes.

## Motor

The [motor](Motor) (Muscle) functions are controlled by a few general areas including Primary Motor Cortex (aka M1, precentral gyrus, or Brodmann area 4).  

## Senses

The [senses](the senses) each have their own processing systems and regions, each with a some form of mapping where different areas are in control of different aspects of the scent.

## Cognition

### Memory

### Attention
