One subject was so fatigued that they couldn’t distinguishably do MVCs.
One subject had trouble understanding during baseline, possible problem with data. Also had a stim error with 3 minute delay in middle.
One subject didn’t seem to be trying.
The clinical team covered all learnings in this doc so far and have implemented new protocols to hopefully solve the addressable ones starting tomorrow.

One person had BP and HR too high. (Dan-- try 6 breaths. 3 seconds in, hold for 3 seconds, 3 seconds out)
One person didn’t have time and left before finishing ICF. (not accounted for in numbers)
One person didn’t seem to be giving a full effort.
Noticed wires are continually getting tangled so we will be implementing a possible solution of hanging everything on hooks tomorrow morning.

No problems today with computer battery. 
We had two subjects show up too late, we are doing a 15 min late cut off or there is a high chance the trial runs into the next scheduled time. 
The one not pro trial was a battery and reconnection problem with the stimulator. Also subject interrupted stim to go to bathroom. Data not salvageable.
