[Singular Value Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition)

"If m is much larger than n then it is advantageous to first reduce the matrix M to a triangular matrix with the QR decomposition and then use Householder reflections to further reduce the matrix to bidiagonal form; the combined cost is 2mn2 + 2n3 flops (Trefethen & Bau III 1997, Lecture 31)."
