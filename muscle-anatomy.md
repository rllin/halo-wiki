# Muscle Anatomy

## Composition
Muscles are bundles of fascicles, which are bundles of myocytes, or muscle cells.
Muscles are activated at the fascicle level.

## Recruitment
Weaker fascicles are “recruited” for use first, followed by stronger and stronger fascicles.
The total strength produced by the muscle depends on the strength of the neural message from the motor cortex.

## Force-Length Properties
A muscle has a differing maximum forces depending on the deviation from its [resting length](muscle resting length)\.

The active curve is the force created by [contracting the muscle](muscle contraction)\. 
The passive curve is the force of stretching a muscle.
The optimal range is in the peak portion of the total curve (active + passive).


## Force-velocity Properties
A muscle has a differing maximum force depending on the contraction speed, for both [eccentric muscle contractions](eccentric muscle contraction) and [concentric muscle contractions](concentric muscle contraction)\.
