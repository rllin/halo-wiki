# Wiki Tutorial

Check the [Markdown documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for more tricks!

## Quickstart
 - Log in with your Halo account
 - Create a page!
   - Is there something only you know the details of?
   - Is there something you wish you had known when you first joined?
   - Is there something you want in a permanent place rather than in random learning documents strewn all over Google Drive?
 - Don't be afraid to create an incomplete page and ask others to fill in!

## Best Practices
* Use an H1 header at the top of every page
 * For definition pages, this should be the topic that it defines
* Use full names not acronyms for page titles for clarity
 * Exceptions to this include titles like [[Halo-400 MVC-04]] but not [[maximum voluntary contraction]]
* Only capitalize proper nouns
* Name pages so they are easy to be generally referenced on other pages
* Use additional external links in line at the beginning of definition pages
* Use back-links when a topic is a subset of another topic
 * Example: [TMS](transcranial magnetic stimulation) is a form of [NIBS](non invasive brain stimulation)
* Don't be afraid to link to nonexistent internal links you believe should exist! 
 * They will show up in red and can be clicked on to edit

## Editing the side Navigation bar
1. Go to [Navigation](_sidebar)
2. Edit the page to include/remove links
