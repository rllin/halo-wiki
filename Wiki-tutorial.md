## Creating and Editing a Page

1. Hover your mouse over the Tools tab in the upper right hanging off the navbar at the top of your browser
2. Choose the create or edit icon
3. If creating a new page, name your page the way you'd like to generally reference it on other pages (Tip: typically, it is good practice to use full names, not acronyms, for page titles)
4. Link away!

## Best Practices
* Use an H1 header at the top of every page
 * For definition pages, this should be the topic that it defines
* Use full names, not acronyms, for page titles
* Use additional external links in line at the beginning of definition pages
* Use back-links when a topic is a subset of another topic
 * Example: [TMS](transcranial magnetic stimulation) is a form of [NIBS](non invasive brain stimulation)
* Don't be afraid to link to nonexistent internal links you believe should exist! 
 * They will show up in red and can be clicked on to edit

## Editing the side Navigation bar

1. Go to [Navigation](_sidebar)
2. Edit the page to include/remove links

 - Include footnotes!  You'll have to maintain them manually though.

## Footnotes
