## Best Practices
* Use an H1 header at the top of every page
 * For definition pages, this should be the topic that it defines
* Use full names, not acronyms, for page titles
* Name pages so they are easy to be generally referenced on other pages
* Use additional external links in line at the beginning of definition pages
* Use back-links when a topic is a subset of another topic
 * Example: [TMS](transcranial magnetic stimulation) is a form of [NIBS](non invasive brain stimulation)
* Don't be afraid to link to nonexistent internal links you believe should exist! 
 * They will show up in red and can be clicked on to edit
