# Creating and Editing a Page

1. Hover your mouse over the Tools tab in the upper right hanging off the navbar at the top of your browser
2. Choose the create or edit icon
3. If creating a new page, name your page the way you'd like to generally reference it on other pages (Tip: typically, it is good practice to use full names, not acronyms, for page titles)
4. Link away!

# Best Practices
* Use an H1 header at the top of every page
 * For definition pages, this should be the thing that is defined
* Use back-links
 * Example: [NIBS](non invasive brain stimulation) and [TMS](transcranial magnetic stimulation)
