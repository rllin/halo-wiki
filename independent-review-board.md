An [independent review board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board) is a committee that has been formally designated to approve, monitor, and review biomedical and behavioral research involving humans. They conduct some form of risk-benefit analysis in an attempt to determine whether or not research should be done.

The purpose of the review process is to assure, both in advance and by periodic review, that appropriate steps are taken to protect the rights and welfare of humans participating as subjects in a research study. A key goal of IRBs is to protect human subjects from physical or psychological harm, which they attempt to do by reviewing research protocols and related materials.
