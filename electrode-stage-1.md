## Washing Process
1. Put electrode in 70% IPA for 20-30 minutes
2. Remove and let air dry for at least 2 hours

## Current Manufacturing Process
1. Deburr the frontplate and backplate after printing with tiny pliers and a file.
2. Put the backplate into the frontplate and assess fit, all corners should be flush. Deburr more if necessary.
3. Glue the frontplate to backplate with Loctite Super Glue being sure to avoid gluing over the lead holes.
4. Cut Velcro to cover at least the entire backplate of the electrode without hanging off the edges. Trimming with Xacto blade can help.
5. Serialize the electrode with a sticky using Loctite Super Glue
6. Glue nibs to the backplate through the frontplate using Pelco Glue.

## Findings
An overview of the findings that have resulted in the current electrodes.
* Pointy nibs give the same impedance as rounded nibs
* Conductive glue (Pelco Conductive Carbon Glue) gives a lower impedance and has a better hold than Loctite 4541 Biomedical Superglue
 * Probably because we are able to glue the entire inside of the nib, not just the base.
* Loctite 4541 causes problems with the 70% IPA Bath
