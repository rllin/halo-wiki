# Neural anatomy

The neuron can be divided into 3 parts, the dendrite, which receives signals, the soma or cell body, which processes signals, and the axon which sends signals.  A signal begins in the dendrite with normally many different axons from other neurons delivering signals.  These signals can be either positive or negative (excitatory or inhibitory) and it is the sum of all of these signals that affect whether or not a neuron fires.  Essentially each input affects the charge of the neuron and if the charge gets above a certain point, or threshold the neuron will fire and cause an action potential.  The signal propagates down the axon to deliver messages to the whichever neurons are connected to the axon via synapses.  Brain stimulation works by changing what the threshold of a neuron is, making neurons more or less likely to fire.

# Action Potential

An action potential is the name for the signal being sent by a neuron down its axon to other neurons.  There are a few key facts about action potentials:
1. Action Potentials are threshold dependent.  As stated above, the cellular charge or membrane potential must pass a certain threshold before an action potential will occur.  Brain stimulation works by changing how much input is needed to pass that threshold.
2. Action potentials are All or None.  An action potential has a set strength of signal.  once that threshold is passed, the neuron is sending a signal with as much force as it can.  Instead to convey a "stronger" signal, the rate at which the signals are sent is used to send stronger or weaker signals.
3. Refractory Periods exist.  A refractory period is the amount of time needed between signals for the neuron to reset.  There is a relative refractory period, which can be overridden with a strong enough signal, and an absolute refractory period, which cannot be overridden regardless of the strength of signal.

# Synapse

The synapse is the space between neurons where a signal is passed from one neuron to another.  Signal is passed via the release of neurotransmitters which cross the synapse and bind to the dendrite of the next neuron, causing a change in membrane potential and starting the cycle over.

## The Neuromuscular Junction

The [[neuromuscular junction]] is a special form of the synapse between a motor neuron and a muscle.
