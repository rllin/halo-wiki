Types of tECS:
* [transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)](transcranial direct current stimulation)
* [transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)](transcranial alternating current stimulation)
* [transcranial variable frequency stimulation (tVFS)](transcranial variable frequency stimulation)
