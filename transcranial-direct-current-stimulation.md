# transcranial direct current stimulation
[Transcranial direct current stimulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_direct-current_stimulation) (tDCS) is a form of [transcranial electric current stimulation (tECS)](transcranial electric current stimulation) which delivers a constant, low current (1-2mA) through the brain area of interest via electrodes on the scalp. 
Tests on healthy adults demonstrated that tDCS can increase cognitive performance on a variety of tasks, depending on the area of the brain being stimulated.[1] It has been utilized to enhance language and mathematical ability, attention span, problem solving, memory, and coordination.
It is by far the most studied form of [NIBS](non invasive brain stimulation)

## Polarity Dependence
tDCS increases or decreases the excitability of neurons, depending on the [polarity]() of the current.
* Anodal (+) increases excitability (anodal electrode over target area)
* Cathodal (-) decreases excitability (cathodal electrode over target area)

## Effects
tDCS has been shown to have lasting effects for stimulations longer than 5 minutes.
tDCS has also been shown to have a negative feedback for stimulations longer than 30 minutes, decreasing the effectiveness of the stimulation.
A stimulation of 20 minutes will have lasting effects for roughly 1 hour
