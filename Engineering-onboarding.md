# Electrodes (and possibly controllers and transmitters soon)
This section will contain everything you need to know about electrodes!
## The Observation Log
There are many reasons why we serialize and log the use of our electrodes. It allows us to account for every electrode we've made and also let's us troubleshoot any malfunctions that occur. Find the log below!
[Serial Log](https://pacific-basin-8674.herokuapp.com/admin/observation/)
Here are the observations that we record for every electrode:
* Manufacturing materials & processes
* Assignment (whenever it leaves the office) & Unassignment
* Use
* Cleaning
* QA Testing
* Maintenance
* Malfunctions

## Using the Observation Log
If you need to add an observation to the log, follow these steps:
1. Click on the "Create" tab
2. Click "Add Serial" and enter the serial number(s) of the electrode(s)
3. Pick the correct activity. If the activity is not in the list, click "Activity" in the navigation bar and add the activity
4.  Write a brief summary of the observation. See previous observations for guidance.
5. Upload an image, if necessary
6. Initial the observation and click "Save"!
