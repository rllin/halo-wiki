# Electrodes
This page is all about electrodes!!
Interested about the other components of Stage 1?

## Overview

## Use Logging
Log anything that happens to an electrode, including test results, in the [Observation Log](https://pacific-basin-8674.herokuapp.com/admin/observation/?sort=4&desc=1)\! 
See this internal link [Observation Log](observation log) for more info.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter impedance problems with an electrode, try the following tests to figure out why it may not be working.
For all tests, make sure the electrode is properly salinated (by either brining & water spray or soaking in saline).

### Across Nib Test
1. Soak the electrode
2. Place each lead on opposite ends of a single nib which failed the Lead to Nib Test
3. Normal impedance is <300 ohms
4. Test on multiple nibs to see if there is a difference between nibs
If this test fails, the nib is definitely one of the problems. Try the other tests to see if other things may be wrong too!

### Lead to Nib Test
1. Soak the electrode
2. Place one lead into the lead slot on the electrode
3. Place the other lead on the end of a nib
4. Normal impedance is <2000 ohms
5. Test on multiple nibs to see if there is a difference between nibs
If this test fails, there is either a problem with the nib or connection between the nib and electrode.
