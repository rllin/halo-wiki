# Halo 200 Series
This is the [[research review]] for the Halo 200 series.

## Halo 200
* Task: 3 back and backward digit span (memory task)
* Stimulation: 1.5 mA or sham to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 20 minutes 
* Type of stimulation: tDCS
* Stim: n=15, sham: n= 17
* Results: 
 * Improvement in 3 back ability with respect to baseline: overall effect of treatment is  significant at p=0.0073
 * Improvement in mean backward span ability with respect to baseline:overall effect is not significant at p = 0.21
* Implications: Stimulation significantly improves performance on 3 back task but not for backward digit span 

## Halo 201     
* Task: 3 back and backward digit span
* Stimulation: 1.5 mA or sham to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 13 or 30 minutes (2 days) 
* Type of stimulation: tDCS
* 65 subjects analyzed 
* Results: no effects for 13 minutes or 30 minutes for either task
* Implications: 

## Halo 202
* Task: 3 back and backward digit span
* Stimulation: 1.5 mA or sham to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 21 minutes 
* Type of Stimulation: tDCS
* 90 subjects analyzed 
* Results: inconclusive 
 * improvement from baseline (low performing subjects): p = 0.751
 * improvement from baseline (high performing subjects): p=0.37
* Implications: 

## Halo 203
* Task: 3 back
* Stimulation: 1.5 mA or sham to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 21 minutes 
* Type of stimulation: tDCS
* 34 subjects analyzed
* Results: insignificant - no difference between sham or stimulation condition
* Implications: 

## Halo 203.1
* Task: 3 back
* Stimulation: 1.1mA or sham to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 18 minutes
* Type of Stimulation: tDCS
* 27 subjects analyzed 
* Results: 
* Implications: 

## Halo 204
* Task: 3 back 
* Stimulation: 1.4mA or sham to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 21 minutes 
* Type of Stimulation: tDCS
* 40 subjects analyzed
* Results: (note: ** a Fisher z transformation was applied to the data) 
 * mean improvement from baseline (all subjects): p=0.2721
 * mean improvement from baseline (low-performing subjects): p=0.0004
 * mean improvement from baseline (medium-performing subjects): p=0.0053
 * mean improvement from baseline (high-performing subjects): p=.1457
* Implications: More profound results for low and medium performing subjects
