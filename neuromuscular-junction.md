The Neuromuscular Junction is how [motor](Motor) neurons communicate with muscles.  The basic principles are similar to a [[neural synapse]] except that there are different preferred neurotransmitters and the synapse is between a neuron and a muscle instead of neuron - neuron.

The signal starts with the [[neuron]], an action potential is propagated down the axon to the synapse.  At the synapse vesicles (packets) of acetylcholine (ACh) are released into the synaptic cleft (that space between the neuron and the muscle).  The acetylcholine binds to receptors on the muscle which allow for an inflow of potassium which activates the muscle, causing the fibers directly connected to the neuron to contract.

The connection between a muscle and a neuron can be strengthened by increasing the number of neuromuscular junctions between the axon of the nerve and all its endings and the muscle.  This creates a greater recruitment of muscle fibers from the same neural signal, allowing for stronger, faster muscle movements.
