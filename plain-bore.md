> Plain bores, often referred to as minimum plain bores or MPB, are simply untapered bores drilled through the center of a pulley, gear, sprocket, or sheave. Sometimes component part numbers use MPB to designate the plain bore style.
> Finished bores are plain bores with the addition of either a keyway, set screws, or both. Timing pulleys and roller chain sprockets often use a F in the part number to illustrate a finished bore. [1]
