[spectral density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density)

"Summation or integration of the spectral components yields the... variance (in a statistical process), identical to what would be obtained by integrating  x^2(t) over the time domain, as dictated by Parseval's theorem." [Wikipedia, Spectral Density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density)
