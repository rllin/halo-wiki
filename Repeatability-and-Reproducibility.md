[Repeatability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeatability) and [Reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) (R&R) refers to studies which quantify the degree to which an action is both repeatable--can be done by the same operator with a low degree of variance--and reproduceable--can be performed by different operators with a low degree of variance. This is often referred to as "R&R" and is sometimes mistakenly called "RNR."
