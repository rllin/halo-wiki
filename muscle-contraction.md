A [muscle contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction) is the activation of tension-generating sites within muscle fibers.

There are three types:
* [Concentric contractions](concentric muscle contraction) (muscle shortening)
* [Eccentric contractions](eccentric muscle contraction) (muscle lengthening)
* [Isometric contractions](isometric muscle contraction) (muscle length static)

Also see:
* [Isotonic contractions](isotonic muscle contraction) (constant force lengthening or shortening)
